        <h2>About Andreas</h2>
        <p>Marketing your business in a foreign market can feel scary – and fair enough. I bet you’ve put a lot of thought into how your brand is presented and invested time and money into making sure your copy is on point. You want to safeguard that carefully crafted image when you enter a new market, and that’s valid.</p>
        <p>I have been a localisation specialist for the Swedish market for eight years, and if there is one conclusion I can draw from my experience it is this; when it comes to marketing content, standard translation isn't good enough.</p>
        <p>So many companies fail to understand this. When you put a marketing message out into the world, you are not primarily communicating information, you are communicating a tone and a vision, and you are inviting people to buy into that vision. The simple truth is that you can’t translate a tone, or a vision, or the essence of a brand simply by translating words and sentences.</p>
        <p>Successfully transferring your marketing message to a foreign market is a delicate and complex process. It requires a deep understanding of your vision, a keen awareness of subtle cultural nuances in both the source and target cultures, and the creative copywriting skills required to adapt and remold your message so that it resonates with your foreign target audience while staying true to your brand. This is not a standard translation task. For a task like this, you need a transcreator. And the good news is you’ve found one.</p>
        <p>Hi, I’m Andreas, and I help interesting businesses connect with interested customers on the Swedish market.</p>
